# Mortalis Game Engine

This is an open source C++ Game Engine Project, based on SFML library.

The goal of this project is both create a 2D RPG game (like Pokemon, Zelda or Final Fantasy) and a reusable game engine for any 2D game.

To compile this project, you could use any compiler as long as they provide C++17 support (like GCC 7). You also need the SFML 2.5 library.
