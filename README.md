# Mortalis-Game-Engine

This is an open source Game Engine Project.

The goal of this project is both create a 2D RPG game (like Pokemon, Zelda or Final Fantasy) and a reusable game engine for any 2D game.

I use C++ progamming language, with the new functionnalities offer by C++17 (known as C++1z), and the SFML library.
